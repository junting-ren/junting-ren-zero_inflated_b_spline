# A semi-parametric model for semi-continous data

This is the R code for Bayesian zero-inflated mixture B-spline density model for semi-continuous data. There are two models available to choose from for the weights of the mixture: an ordinal probit model or a multinomial logistic model.  
  
To start, please refer to the main_probit.RMD or main.RMD file in the simulation folder for the ordinal probit version or multinomial logistic version respectively.
